<h1>My useful qualities</h1>

<div class="content skills">

	<p class="emphasis">I'm a creative person...</p>
	
		<p class="push">Adept at <span>crafting clean interfaces</span> for both mobile and desktop.</p>
		
		<p class="push">Hands-on experience with <span>designing and wireframing</span> all types of things &#8212; social applications, content management systems, content production tools, and more.</p>
		
		<p class="push">Expert in <span>Photoshop</span>, <span>Illustrator</span> and mock-up tools such as <span>Balsamiq</span>.</p>
		
	
	<p class="emphasis">...with a technical bent.</p>
	
		<p class="push">Tons of experience with <span>HTML</span>, <span>CSS</span> and <span>JavaScript</span>.</p>
		
		<p class="push">I'm also a coder &#8212; with intimate knowledge of <span>PHP</span> and <span>MySQL</span>,<br>
		 and a firm foundation in OO languages like Java and Python.</p>
			
		<p class="push">I've used <span>jQuery Mobile</span>, <span>iUI</span>, and <span>Titanium</span> to build mobile apps &#8212;<br>
			and am experienced with optimizing websites for the mobile web.</p>
		
		
	<p class="emphasis">I'm a leader and collaborator.</p>
	
		<p class="push">I've led many teams, both professional and academic, over the years &#8212; familiarizing me with the challenges that arise in group environments, and how to overcome them.</p>
		
		
		
	<p class="emphasis">But above all, I'm a problem solver.</p>
		
		<p class="push"><span>My passion for this stuff borders on mania.</span><br>
			I've spent innumerable late nights on projects, usually without relation to any particular deadline. It's not about clients, specs, deadlines, rewards or punishments... so much as satiating a desire to build awesome things!</p>
			
		<p class="push"><span>I'm a big thinker with my head in the clouds</span>  (or perhaps <i>the</i> cloud)<br>
			At the end of the day, it's about making the web a more useful and transformative tool.<br>
			I'm a designer by trade, but a visionary at heart. I do this not just for the fun (although it's tons of fun), 
			but to make life more enjoyable for people.</p>
		
		<p class="push"><span>My favorite challenges are ones that have yet to be tackled.</span><br>
			I've always told myself that if I can't find the answer on Google, I'm on the right track...</p>
