title: "Exploiting Your Data"

---

Much ado has been made in recent years about all the data we're generating online, and the resultant privacy concerns.

For instance, in 2011 we learned that smartphones are continuously [recording our location](http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/apple-location-tracking.html), which is then stored and used by companies like Apple and Google.

Last month, we learned that the NSA has strong-armed internet companies into [sharing user data](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/12/heres-everything-we-know-about-prism-to-date/) from their systems, in order to combat terrorism.

The list goes on and on, and it seems to grow increasingly faster over time. The fact of the matter is: the powers-that-be care little for your qualms about privacy.

Yes, your data is compromised the moment it's created. Sure, you can [protect yourself](http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/06/07/Protect-yourself-from-prism.html?page=all) to a limited extent, but inevitably certain metrics will fall into other people's hands. Your location, the types of things you do online, etc.

However, for all the rage that folks are expressing about this stuff, one question seems to remain un-asked… *How can we exploit our data more effectively?*

Right now, this data benefits very few people. Advertisers, mostly. Perhaps we've seen some minor improvements to networking infrastructure. And if the NSA is to be believed, we've also made some headway on thwarting terrorists. 

I suppose the latter two are noble endeavors, but overall our data is being applied toward some very narrow-minded ends. In essence: our private data is being horribly under-utilized.

Terrorism is an exaggerated threat. Compared to alternate methods of dying, it's statistically non-existent. At this point, the "War on Terror" is mainly a justification for expanded governmental authority, rather than a tangible contribution to society.

Let me step out on a limb here… If we were to *fully accept* the loss of our privacy regarding certain types of data, what would it free us to do?

There is the [OpenPaths](https://openpaths.cc/) initiative, where people can voluntarily donate their location data to various research projects. I think that's a wonderful thing, but they're certainly not privy to the massive volume of data to which our benevolent overlords at the NSA have access.

It seems to me that many more applications exist for this data of ours, which could bring drastic improvements to our daily lives – if only the right people were able to get their hands on it.

I, for one, accept this new reality – and I encourage people to focus less on how we can kick, stomp, and scream our little walled garden of Eden back into existence… and more on finding meaningful uses for this data of ours.
